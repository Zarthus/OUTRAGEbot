TwitchBot is an IRC bot fork from [OUTRAGEbot](https://github.com/Westie/OUTRAGEbot)

TwitchBot is PHP written IRC bot that connects to twitch, with your provided account and oauth token.  
Currently TwitchBot has one *script* `TwitchLogger`, which tracks what commands people use from `#twitchplayspokemon` (or [TwitchPlaysPokemon on Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv/twitchplayspokemon) repectively).
